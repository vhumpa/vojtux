# What is it about?

This repository contains resources concerning unofficial Linux distribution aimed at visually impaired users. This distribution is called Vojtux. It is based on first name of the main contributor; Vojtech.

The repo currently contains Kickstart files to create a live media image with accessible environment. This image can be later used to install the system on a device. It contains kickstart files to build the distro with English or Czech language selected.

The live media is currently based on Fedora 38.

## Building live media ISO

The kickstart file is inspired by the Fedora Mate spin. The Mate environment is chosen because it is lightweight and its accessibility is prety good.

Kickstart documentation can be found at <https://pykickstart.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kickstart-docs.html>.

Building of this image requires Fedora. It is strongly recommended to use Fedora version matching the one you are going to build. So if you are going to build a live media based on Fedora 38, it is strongly recommended to do it from Fedora 38 environment.

So how to build it?

1. sudo dnf install lorax-lmc-novirt

2. clone this repo

3. create a directory structure to store cache and tmp files (optional)

    - mkdir -p live/tmp

4. ksflatten -c <input_kickstart_file.ks> -o <output_kickstart_file.ks>

    - choose ks/vojtux_cs.ks or ks/vojtux_en.ks as an input file, based on your language choice

    - this makes sure that all includes will be handled correctly

5. sudo livemedia-creator --make-iso --no-virt --iso-only  --anaconda-arg="--noselinux" --iso-name vojtux_38.iso --project vojtux --releasever 38 --ks <output_kickstart_file.ks> --tmp live/tmp

    - --make-iso creates ISO image. Note that you can create multiple things with livemedia-creator.

    - --no-virt uses local Anaconda to perform the installation without spinning up virtual machine. This is probably not mandatory, but I chose this approach because I am actually building the image within virtual machine running Fedora.

    - --iso-only - after the process finishes, delete all artifacts except for the resulting ISO image. You may omit this if you need to inspect intermediate artifacts.

    - --anaconda-arg="--noselinux" disables selinux during the installation, it was causing problems.

    - --iso-name vojtux_38.iso provides name for the resulting ISO image

    - --project vojtux project name, this is used as image label and it is visible in the boot menu

    - --releasever 38 this is also visible in the boot menu

    - --ks <output_kickstart_file.ks> use the kickstart file created in previous steps

    - --tmp live/tmp optional argument if you want to use your own defined tmp directory

## Docker build

There is a simple build.sh script included to show the sequence that I used to build the image.

```
./dockerbuild/build.sh
```

Which should end in something like:

```
sudo find ./dockerbuild/output -name vojtux_38.iso
./dockerbuild/output/vojtux_38.iso
```

Your `vojtux_38.iso` should be listed as above.

## What is actually done?

The result will be stored in the tmp directory in a folder with randomly generated name. In this folder there will be a file called according to the --iso-name parameter. The live image is based on Fedora 38 Mate spin.
